# The HODL Trust (https://hodltrust.com)

Create trusts on the Ethereum blockchain. With tokens and optional dividend program.


## What is the HODL Trust?

The HODL Trust is a decentralized Ethereum application that lets you create simple trusts on the blockchain. A trust holds ether for a beneficiary until a maturity date of your choice, after which the beneficiary can withdraw the deposited amount. There is also an optional dividends program.

## Why use HODL Trust?
Simple: Create a trust without lawyers, banks, or other third parties.

Easy: Create a trust in one operation, specifying a beneficiary & period.

Free: There are no fees for using HODL Trust.

Private: Both parties are identified only by Ethereum addresses.

Flexible: Choose any amount, beneficiary, and period. Create unlimited trusts.

Irrevocable: The terms of the trusts are immutable.

Save & Invest: Protect against impulsive spending and speculative trading.

Charity: Set up a charitable trust for a nonprofit.

Dividends: Opt-in to the dividend program to earn HODL coins and ether.

## Optionally earn HODL coins and ETH dividends
Upon creating a trust, grantors can choose to receive HODL coins and participate in the lapsed trust redistribution program. This imposes a one-year claim period on the trust: if the beneficiary does not claim the trust within a year of its maturity, the trust lapses and can be redistributed as dividends to HODL coin bearers.

HODL coins entitle the bearer to a share of those lapsed trusts. Dividends owed to long-inactive accounts (five years) may also be redistributed to HODL coin-bearers.

Grantors receive one HODL coin per ether-year they've committed to.

Participation in the HODL coin / dvidend program is optional. If the grantor chooses to not receive HODL coins, their trust will have a 100-year claim period.
